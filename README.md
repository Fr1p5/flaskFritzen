# Instructions
<p>
    The object of the game is to roll 30 eyes or higher, or 10 eyes or lower, using 6 dices.
    <br>
    Decide who can start the game. The round goes clockwise. Each player has one chance to do the following:
    <br>
    Everyone may throw a maximum of five fimes and may leave on or more dice after each roll. Dice may not be changed, everything you hvae left is left over!
    It is of course also possible to throw less than five times, if you have reached you goal (10 or lower or 30 or higher) you do not have to roll.
</p>

### 30 or higher
<p>
    If you roll 30, you are even and don't have to drink. You can give all eyes over 30 that you throw in shots to one or more other players. If you throw under
    30, you have to drink the number of eyes under 30 in shots.
</p>
### 10 or higher
<p>
    You roll 10, you are even and you don't have to drink. You can hand out all eyes under 10 in shots. You have to drink all the eyes that you throw above 10
    yourself.
</p>

### Extra rules
<p>
    If you roll below 10, you may let one of the players to whom you have given shots drink again. This by throwing all six dices again five times. You can leave 
    any 1 that falls and that means an extra shot for the victim. Makes the total of the eyes 20, after the fifth roll, everyone drinks except the one who throws.
